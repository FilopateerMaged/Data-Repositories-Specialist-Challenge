# Data-Repositories-Specialist-Challenge
This repository holds my attempt at 3 XML Parsing challenges in python\
I had no XML knwoledge, parsing libraries or pandas prior to this\
I didn't spend time making sure time complexity was the greatest \
the code is commented to show my approach of breaking every challenge into smaller pieces and working my way through
